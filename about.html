                                    <br>
                                    <p>While I'm currently building some pretty basic games, I plan to create more story-driven and sophisticated games as I continue to learn. I've been playing games for most of my life, and I find building games to be a great way to practice and learn throughout my journey into software development. When a project can be something a person can enjoy, it helps them to stay motivated and work through a continuous progression. I've only started this journey over the last few months, but you're welcome to play all the games that I create, and I encourage you to provide feedback along the way.</p>

                                    <br>
                                    <p>This is simply a project I'm putting together for myself to streamline my development education. I'll make mistakes along the way, and things will be rather simplistic for a while. As such, any games I post for the foreseeable future will be free to play. No membership, no purchase fee, just free. Thanks for playing.</p>

                                    <p>I can't remember a time when I didn't play video games. I still revisit some of the classics for speed runs and a nostalgia kick. Games are a way to engage the mind and are proven to have numerous cognitive benefits. And, well, they're super fun.</p>
